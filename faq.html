      <h2>Planning & Timing</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>When is the best time to visit New Orleans for a bachelorette?</h3>
        <p>March-May and October-November are ideal. The weather is comfortable (70s-80s), the city is active, and you avoid the brutal summer humidity. Mardi Gras season (February/March) is amazing but more expensive and crowded.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How far in advance should we book?</h3>
        <p>For accommodations that fit large groups, book 3-6 months ahead. Popular restaurants need 2-3 weeks notice for parties of 10+. Activities like spa days or classes should be booked 2-3 weeks out.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How many days do we need?</h3>
        <p>3 days / 2 nights is the sweet spot. Arrive Friday afternoon, leave Sunday afternoon. You can do 4 days if your group has the time and budget, but 3 is plenty to experience the city without exhaustion.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Should we avoid any weekends?</h3>
        <p>Check for major events: Saints home games make hotels expensive, big conventions can book up accommodations. Mardi Gras, Jazz Fest, and Essence Fest are amazing but require earlier planning and higher budgets.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-section">
      <h2>Budget & Money</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What's a realistic budget per person?</h3>
        <p>For a 3-day weekend, expect $500-900 per person total. This breaks down roughly to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Accommodations (split): $150-250</li>
          <li>Food (all meals): $200-300</li>
          <li>Drinks & nightlife: $100-200</li>
          <li>Activities: $50-100</li>
          <li>Ubers/transportation: $30-50</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do we handle payments as a group?</h3>
        <p>Designate one person to book everything and collect via Venmo/Zelle. For accommodations, collect deposits upfront. For restaurants, either split checks or have one person pay and Venmo after.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Should the bride pay for anything?</h3>
        <p>Traditionally, the bride doesn't pay for accommodations or activities—it's split among the guests. She may cover her own flights and incidentals. Discuss expectations with your group early.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What's the tipping culture like?</h3>
        <p>20% for restaurants, bars, and services. Some places add automatic gratuity for large groups (18-20%). Always tip your tour guides, spa staff, and anyone providing a service.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-section">
      <h2>Accommodations</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Should we get a hotel or vacation rental?</h3>
        <p>For groups of 10+, a vacation rental is almost always better. You stay together, have private outdoor space, and often pay less per person than multiple hotel rooms. Hotels work for smaller groups or those who prefer turndown service.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What neighborhoods should we stay in?</h3>
        <p>The French Quarter and CBD are most convenient for nightlife. The Marigny and Bywater are artsy and fun. Garden District is beautiful but requires Ubers to get around. Avoid staying too far from the action.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do we split beds fairly?</h3>
        <p>Options: first-deposit-first-choice, random lottery, or let the bride and MOH pick first. Some groups charge slightly more for private rooms. Figure this out before you arrive to avoid drama.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-section">
      <h2>What to Bring</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What should everyone pack?</h3>
        <p>Essential packing list:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Comfortable walking shoes (cobblestones are rough)</li>
          <li>Going-out outfits and one nice dinner outfit</li>
          <li>Swimsuit (for pool if your rental has one)</li>
          <li>Light layers (AC is aggressive, outside is humid)</li>
          <li>Sunglasses and sunscreen</li>
          <li>Matching bach gear (if that's your thing)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do we need matching outfits?</h3>
        <p>Totally optional. If you do, keep it simple—matching tank tops or swimsuits are fun without being over the top. Save the sashes and tiaras for day two.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What decorations should we bring for the house?</h3>
        <p>Less is more. A few balloons, a banner, and maybe some fun pool floats. Most hosts don't love excessive decorations, and you're mostly going to be out anyway.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-section">
      <h2>Getting Around</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do we need a car?</h3>
        <p>No. In fact, a car is a liability—parking is expensive and you'll be drinking. Uber/Lyft everywhere. The French Quarter and surrounding neighborhoods are very walkable during the day.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How much do Ubers typically cost?</h3>
        <p>Most rides within the city are $8-15. Airport to French Quarter is about $25-35. Expect surge pricing late at night on weekends. Budget $30-50 per person for the whole trip.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is the streetcar worth taking?</h3>
        <p>The St. Charles streetcar is a fun, scenic ride through the Garden District. Take it once for the experience, but it's slow—don't rely on it to get places quickly.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-section">
      <h2>Safety & Logistics</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is New Orleans safe for bachelorette groups?</h3>
        <p>Like any city, use common sense. Stick together, especially at night. Uber instead of walking late night. Stay aware of your surroundings. Most tourist areas are well-patrolled and safe for groups.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What about the drinking—is there really no last call?</h3>
        <p>Correct. Bars can stay open 24/7 and you can walk around with open containers. This is great until it's not. Pace yourselves, stay hydrated, and know when to call it.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do we handle someone who has too much?</h3>
        <p>Buddy system. Have a plan. Know where you're staying and make sure everyone has the address. Designate a "responsible friend" each night. New Orleans is fun, but it can catch up with you.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-section">
      <h2>Food & Dining</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do we make reservations for large groups?</h3>
        <p>Call directly—don't rely on apps for groups of 10+. Call 2-3 weeks ahead, mention it's a bachelorette, and be flexible on timing. Restaurants are usually accommodating for celebrations.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What if someone in our group has dietary restrictions?</h3>
        <p>New Orleans restaurants are generally accommodating. Call ahead for serious allergies. Vegetarian options exist but are limited—it's a meat-heavy food culture. Vegan is harder but possible with planning.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What foods should we definitely try?</h3>
        <p>The essentials: beignets at Café Du Monde, a po'boy (shrimp or roast beef), gumbo or jambalaya, oysters (chargrilled or raw), and something from a fancy dinner. Don't leave without trying at least a few of these.</p>
