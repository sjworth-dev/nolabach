### Outdoor Adventures

Don't knock it. A swamp tour is genuinely one of the most memorable things you can do in Louisiana. You'll see alligators, learn about Cajun culture, and have stories to tell.

- Cost: ~$35/person
- Best time: Morning (fewer crowds, cooler)

Hire a local photographer to capture your crew in the most photogenic spots: Jackson Square, the French Quarter, oak-lined streets in the Garden District.

Expect to pay $300-500 for an hour session with edited photos delivered digitally. Worth it for the memories.

*Recommended photographers available on request.*

**DIY Photo Walk**

Hit these spots with your phones:
1. Jackson Square (cathedral backdrop)
2. Pirate's Alley (moody side street)
3. Royal Street balconies

## Nighttime Activities

### Bar Crawls & Nightlife

**Bourbon Street**
You have to walk through it once. Get a Hand Grenade, take a photo, move on. It's touristy and messy, but it's part of the experience.

**Frenchmen Street**
This is where you actually want to spend your night. Live music in every bar, more locals than tourists, incredible energy. Start at The Spotted Cat and let the night take you.

**Rooftop Bars**

*Hot Tin* (Pontchartrain Hotel)
Best views in the city. Craft cocktails, stylish crowd. Perfect for sunset drinks before dinner.

*Alto* (Ace Hotel)
Trendy rooftop with a pool (daytime). Great cocktails and DJ sets at night.

### Unique Night Experiences

**Ghost & Cemetery Tours**

*Haunted History Tours*
Walk through the French Quarter at night hearing stories of ghosts, vampires, and voodoo. Campy but fun, especially after a few drinks.
- Duration: 2 hours
- Cost: ~$30/person
- Best time: 8pm tours

**Jazz Cruise**

*Steamboat Natchez*
Dinner cruise on the Mississippi with live jazz. Touristy but romantic. Good for a more "sophisticated" night if your group isn't all about the clubs.
