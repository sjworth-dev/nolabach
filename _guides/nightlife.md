New Orleans has no last call. Bars literally never close. This is both a blessing and a curse. Here's how to navigate it.

---

## The Main Areas

### Frenchmen Street
*Where You Should Actually Go*

This is it. The real New Orleans music scene. Every bar has live jazz, brass bands, or funk. Way better than Bourbon Street, with a more local crowd.

**Must-hits:**

**The Spotted Cat Music Club**
Standing room only, incredible jazz, zero pretension. This is the quintessential Frenchmen experience. Get there early if you want to see the band.

**d.b.a.**
More space than Spotted Cat, excellent live music, great beer selection. Good spot when Spotted Cat is too packed.

**The Maison**
Three floors, multiple bands playing at once. More of a party vibe. Good late night.

**Blue Nile**
Upstairs balcony overlooking Frenchmen. DJs and dancing late night after the live music winds down.

**Bamboula's**
Late night dance party spot. This is where you end up at 2am dancing to brass band remixes.

### Bourbon Street
*Get It Out of Your System*

Look, you're going to walk through it at least once. That's fine. It's messy, loud, touristy, and kind of fun in small doses.

**What to actually do there:**

1. Get a Hand Grenade (the neon green drink) — it's tradition
2. Walk the length once, taking it all in
3. Pop into Pat O'Brien's for a Hurricane in the courtyard
4. Leave and go somewhere better

**Skip:** Most of the clubs. They're overpriced, aggressive, and not worth your time.

---

### Magazine Street
*The Chill Alternative*

If your group wants drinks without the chaos, Magazine Street in the Garden District has cute bars and restaurants. More wine bar vibes than dance floor.

**Good spots:**
- **The Bulldog** — 50 beers on tap, great patio
- **Cure** — Best cocktails in the city
- **Barrel Proof** — Whiskey bar with 300+ bottles

---

### The Bywater / Marigny
*The Artsy Side*

Funky, eclectic neighborhoods with dive bars, art galleries, and a bohemian vibe. Good for groups who want something different.

**Check out:**
- **Bacchanal Wine** — Wine bar with live music and a backyard
- **The Country Club** — Pool, hot tub, restaurant, very NOLA
- **Saturn Bar** — Weird and wonderful dive bar

---

## Rooftop Bars

### Hot Tin
*Best Views*

Rooftop of the Pontchartrain Hotel in the Garden District. Stunning views of the city skyline, craft cocktails, stylish crowd. Perfect for sunset drinks.

### Alto
*The Trendy One*

Rooftop at the Ace Hotel. Pool during the day (hotel guests), bar and DJ at night. Young, hip crowd.

### The Catahoula Hotel Rooftop
*The Hidden Gem*

Smaller, less crowded, great pisco cocktails. Nice for a more intimate group hangout.

---

## Dance Clubs

If your group wants to actually dance (beyond the live music venues):

### Republic
*The Big One*

Large dance club in the Warehouse District. Multiple rooms, bottle service available, DJs on weekends.

### Santos
*Late Night*

Opens late (midnight), goes until 6am. Electronic music, serious dancing.

### The Drifter Hotel Pool
*Summer Only*

Not a club, but they do pool parties with DJs. Very fun, very Instagram.

---

## Cocktail Bars

For the group that appreciates a well-made drink:

### Cure
*Best Overall*

Apothecary-style cocktail bar. Serious drinks in a beautiful space. This is where bartenders drink.

### Bar Tonique
*French Quarter Adjacent*

No-nonsense cocktail bar. Classic drinks done perfectly. Cash only.

### The Sazerac Bar
*Historic*

Inside the Roosevelt Hotel. Where the Sazerac cocktail was invented. Gorgeous room, impeccable drinks.

### Jewel of the South
*Upscale*

James Beard award-winning bar. Historic cocktails with modern technique.

## The Perfect Night Out

### Early Evening (6-8pm)
Start with cocktails at a rooftop bar. Hot Tin for views, or Cure if your group is cocktail-focused.

### Dinner (8-10pm)
Eat somewhere great. You need the fuel.

### Prime Time (10pm-1am)
Head to Frenchmen Street. Start at The Spotted Cat, then bounce around as you hear different bands.

### Late Night (1-3am)
If you're still going: Bamboula's for dancing, or The Maison's upstairs.

### Very Late Night
Late night eats: Verti Marte (the "All That Jazz" po'boy), Clover Grill (24-hour diner), or Dat Dog.

## Safety Tips

1. **Stick together** — Use the buddy system, especially late night
2. **Watch your drinks** — Standard bar safety applies
3. **Uber/Lyft everywhere** — Don't walk alone at night
4. **Know your limits** — No last call means you have to set your own
5. **Stay hydrated** — Seriously, it's humid and you're drinking a lot
