Coordinating a big group trip is like herding cats—expensive, opinionated cats with different flight schedules. Here's exactly how to pull it off.

---

## Step 1: Get Organized Early

### Set Up Your Command Center

Before you do anything else, create your communication hub:

**Group Chat (Pick One):**
- **WhatsApp** — Best for groups with mixed phone types, supports polls
- **iMessage** — Great if everyone has iPhones
- **Facebook Messenger** — Good if your group is active on FB
- **Slack** — Overkill for most, but organized people love it

**Money Management (Essential):**
- **Splitwise** — Tracks who owes what automatically. Game changer for groups.
- **Venmo/Zelle** — For actually moving money
- **Google Sheets** — For the organizer who wants full control

**Shared Planning:**
- **Google Doc** — For itinerary, links, and info everyone needs
- **Google Sheets** — For budget tracking and RSVPs
- **Shared Apple Note** — Simple, works if everyone has iPhones

### The Planning Timeline

**6 Months Out:**
- [ ] Propose dates (give 2-3 options)
- [ ] Get firm commitments and deposits ($100-150 per person)
- [ ] Book accommodations immediately

**3 Months Out:**
- [ ] Book flights (share flight info in group chat)
- [ ] Research activities and restaurants
- [ ] Assign roles (more on this below)

**1 Month Out:**
- [ ] Make dinner reservations (call directly for 10+)
- [ ] Book activities (spa, classes, tours)
- [ ] Finalize headcount and collect remaining balance

**1 Week Out:**
- [ ] Confirm all reservations
- [ ] Share final itinerary with everyone
- [ ] Assign Day 1 tasks (groceries, decorations, etc.)

**Day Before:**
- [ ] Stock the house
- [ ] Share address and check-in instructions
- [ ] Create emergency contact list

## Step 2: Handle Money Without Drama

Money ruins trips. Here's how to avoid that.

### The Golden Rules

1. **Collect deposits immediately** — Anyone who doesn't pay isn't really committed
2. **Use Splitwise from Day 1** — Add every expense, even small ones
3. **Settle up daily** — Don't let it pile up until the end
4. **Over-budget by 15%** — Surprises happen

### What to Collect Upfront

| Item | When to Collect | Amount |
|------|-----------------|--------|
| Initial deposit | At commitment | $100-150 |
| Accommodations balance | 1 month before | Remainder of housing |
| Activity/dinner fund | 1 week before | $150-200 |

### Handling the Bride's Costs

Traditional approach: The bride pays for her flight but the group covers:
- Her portion of housing
- Her meals
- Her activities
- Her drinks (to a reasonable point)

Divide her costs evenly among all other guests when calculating per-person totals.

### Sample Budget Calculator

For a group of 12, 3-night stay:

| Expense | Total Cost | Per Person (11 paying) |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| House rental | $3,000 | $273 |
| Groceries/supplies | $400 | $36 |
| Group dinner 1 | $800 | $73 |
| Group dinner 2 | $1,200 | $109 |
| Group activity | $600 | $55 |
| Decorations/supplies | $150 | $14 |
| **Group Total** | **$6,150** | **$559** |

Individual costs (flights, personal meals, drinks, Ubers) add another $200-400.

## Step 3: Assign Roles

Don't do everything yourself. Delegate.

### Essential Roles

**The Coordinator (You)**
- Books accommodations and manages reservations
- Handles money collection and Splitwise
- Creates and shares itinerary
- Makes final decisions when the group can't

**The Hype Woman**
- Manages group chat energy
- Sends countdown updates
- Handles matching outfits/accessories
- Creates playlists

**The Scout**
- Arrives early to stock the fridge
- Sets up the house (decorations, etc.)
- Has the address and check-in instructions

**The Navigator**
- Handles Uber coordination for the group
- Knows restaurant locations and walking routes
- Keeps track of time during outings

**The Documentarian**
- Takes photos and videos
- Creates shared album for everyone to upload to
- Posts to social media (if bride wants)

### How to Assign

In your group chat:
> "Need volunteers for a few roles to make this weekend run smooth. Who wants:
> - Hype Woman (group chat energy, playlists, matching stuff)
> - Scout (arrive early, stock fridge, set up house)
> - Navigator (Ubers, directions, keeping us on schedule)
> - Documentarian (photos, shared album, social media)"

## Step 4: Transportation for Groups

### Getting to New Orleans

**Flights:**
- Louis Armstrong Airport (MSY) is 30-40 min from French Quarter
- Southwest often has good deals to MSY
- Share flight info in a spreadsheet so people can coordinate

**From the Airport:**
- Uber XL fits 6 people (~$35-45)
- Uber Black SUV fits 6 comfortably (~$60-70)
- Airport Shuttle is cheap but slow (~$24/person)

**Pro tip:** If 4+ people land within an hour of each other, coordinate one Uber XL.

### Getting Around the City

**Walking** — French Quarter, CBD, Marigny, Bywater are all walkable during the day

**Uber/Lyft** — Your main mode of transport
- Regular Uber: 4 people
- Uber XL: 6 people
- For 10+ people, order two cars and share one destination

**Rideshare Tip:** One person orders all Ubers for the group. Settles up on Splitwise later.

### For Large Groups (12+)

**Party Bus/Limo Services:**
- Great for night-out transportation
- Usually $150-300/hour with 3-hour minimums
- Worth it for one big night

Local options:
- NOLA Party Bus
- Big Easy Limos
- Southern Comfort Transportation

**Pedicabs** — Fun for short French Quarter trips, usually $5-10/person

## Step 6: House Rules for Groups

Establish these early to avoid conflict:

### Space Allocation
- **First deposit = first choice** on bedrooms, OR
- **Random lottery** for fairness
- Bride + MOH get first pick regardless
- Pull-out couches go to whoever volunteers (or discount their share)

### Shared Spaces
- Kitchen is shared — clean up after yourself
- Living room is common space — no sleeping in
- Pool area — music stops at 10pm (neighbors)

### Morning vs Night People
- Quiet hours: 12am - 9am in bedrooms
- Early risers should have coffee access without waking others
- Night owls take the party outside or to a bar

### The Bathroom Situation
- Post a morning schedule if there aren't enough bathrooms
- "Ready by X time" means fully ready, not just showered
- Bring your own toiletries — don't assume

## Step 8: What Can Go Wrong (And How to Handle It)

### Someone Drops Out
- Get deposits upfront and make them non-refundable
- If someone drops, remaining group splits their share
- Exception: true emergencies — group decides together

### Someone Can't Afford It
- Offer payment plans
- Assign them a cheaper bedroom option
- Suggest they skip one activity
- Never shame anyone — money stress is real

### Group Can't Agree on Plans
- Coordinator makes final call
- Build in "free time" where people can split up
- Not everything needs to be a group activity

### Drama Between Guests
- Handle privately, not in group chat
- Seat people strategically at dinners
- Have backup plans for activities where people can opt out
- Remember: this is about the bride

### Someone Overdoes It
- Buddy system every night
- Keep the address saved in everyone's phone
- Know the signs of alcohol poisoning
- Don't be afraid to call it early and Uber home
