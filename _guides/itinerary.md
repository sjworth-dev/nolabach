You've got the crew together. You've got the matching shirts. Now you need a plan. Here's exactly how to spend 3 days in New Orleans for a bachelorette party that'll be talked about for years.

---

<h2 id="day-1">Day One: Arrival & Pool Party</h2>

### 2:00 PM - Check In & Settle

Most vacation rentals have 3-4pm check-in times. Use this to your advantage: arrive, claim your beds, pop the first bottles of champagne, and get into those matching swimsuits.

**Pro tip:** Have someone arrive early to stock the fridge. Nothing kills the vibe like a grocery run when everyone's ready to party.

### 4:00 PM - Pool Time

This is why you booked a private villa. No crowded hotel pools, no noise complaints, just your crew, good music, and all the rosé you brought.

Set the scene:
- Create a playlist in advance
- Bring pool floats (flamingos are classic but consider personalized ones)
- Stock a cooler poolside
- Set up a photo station with props

### 7:00 PM - Freshen Up

Give everyone time to shower, do hair/makeup, and get ready for the night. With big groups, you'll need at least 2 hours.

### 9:00 PM - Dinner at Cochon

For your first NOLA meal, go Southern. [Cochon](https://cochonrestaurant.com/) does Louisiana cuisine at its finest—boucherie platters, fried alligator, and cocktails that'll put you in the right mood.

**Reservations essential.** Book at least 2 weeks ahead for groups of 10+.

### 11:00 PM - Night One: The French Quarter

Start easy on night one. Walk around the Quarter, grab a Hand Grenade, peek into Pat O'Brien's for a Hurricane. Save the big night for tomorrow.

End early-ish (1-2am). You've got a big day ahead.

<h2 id="day-2">Day Two: The Main Event</h2>

### 10:00 AM - Brunch at The Ruby Slipper

No bachelorette in NOLA is complete without brunch. [The Ruby Slipper](https://www.therubyslippercafe.net/) serves eggs Cochon de Lait and bottomless mimosas. Expect a wait on weekends—put your name in, then grab beignets next door.

**Alternative for big groups:** [Cafe Amelie](https://www.cafeamelie.com/) has a gorgeous courtyard and takes reservations.

### 1:00 PM - Activity Time

Pick something the bride will love:

**For the Active Bride:**
- Pole dancing or burlesque class at [Bella Blue](https://www.bellablue.com/)
- Paddle board yoga on Bayou St. John
- Dance class (second line, salsa, or jazz)

**For the Relaxed Bride:**
- Spa day at [Spa Aria](https://spaarianeworleans.com/)
- Private tarot reading in the Quarter
- Painting class with wine

**For the Adventurous Bride:**
- Swamp tour (yes, really—it's amazing)
- Cemetery and ghost tour
- Cooking class at [New Orleans School of Cooking](https://www.neworleansschoolofcooking.com/)

### 5:00 PM - Return to Villa

Pool time round two. This is when everyone does final hair and makeup for the big night. Play music, take photos, have fun with it.

### 8:00 PM - Dinner at Commander's Palace

This is *the* New Orleans restaurant. Jacket suggested (for the groom's friends), but the real draw is the 25-cent martinis at lunch. For dinner, it's white tablecloths, impeccable service, and food that lives up to the hype.

Book the Garden Room for groups.

### 10:30 PM - Frenchmen Street

Skip Bourbon (okay, walk through once) and head to Frenchmen Street. This is where locals go. Live jazz and brass bands spill out of every door. Our picks:

- **The Spotted Cat** - Standing room only, incredible jazz
- **d.b.a.** - Great live music, more space
- **The Maison** - Three floors, multiple bands
- **Bamboula's** - Late night dance party

### 2:00 AM - Late Night Eats

You'll be hungry. Options:
- **Verti Marte** (French Quarter) - The "All That Jazz" po'boy is legendary
- **Dat Dog** - Gourmet hot dogs, open late
- **Clover Grill** - 24-hour diner, perfect drunk food

<h2 id="day-3">Day Three: Recovery & Goodbye</h2>

### 10:00 AM - Beignets at Café Du Monde

It's cliché because it's perfect. Get there early-ish to beat the worst of the line. Order beignets and café au lait. Get powdered sugar everywhere. Take the obligatory photos.

### 11:30 AM - Final French Quarter Stroll

Walk off the beignets. Stop at:
- Jackson Square for photos
- Pirate's Alley for that iconic shot
- Any antique shop that catches your eye
- A final cocktail at The Carousel Bar

### 1:00 PM - Check Out

Say your goodbyes, exchange hugs, promise to do it again for someone else's wedding.

## When to Go

**Best months:** March-May, October-November

The weather is perfect, the city is alive, and you'll avoid the brutal summer humidity.

**Consider:**
- **Mardi Gras season** (Feb/March) - Amazing energy but expensive and crowded
- **Jazz Fest** (late April/early May) - Music lovers' paradise
- **Summer** (June-August) - Hot and humid, but cheaper rates

**Avoid:**
- Hurricane season peaks (August-September)
- Major convention weeks (check the calendar)
