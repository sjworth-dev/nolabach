## Restaurant Tips for Groups

### Making Reservations

1. **Call, don't use apps** — For groups of 10+, call directly and explain it's a bachelorette. They're usually accommodating.

2. **Book 2-3 weeks ahead** — Popular spots fill up fast for large parties

3. **Confirm headcount 48 hours before** — Restaurants appreciate knowing final numbers

4. **Ask about private/semi-private spaces** — Many have back rooms for groups

### Paying the Bill

- **Split it in advance** — Decide before dinner if you're splitting evenly or itemizing
- **Venmo the organizer** — One person pays, everyone Venmos after
- **Factor in tip** — 20% on large groups, always
- **Some places add gratuity** — Check if it's included for parties of 8+

### Menu Considerations

- **Dietary restrictions** — Let the restaurant know when booking
- **Family-style ordering** — Often easier for big groups
- **Set menus** — Some restaurants offer prix fixe for parties (simplifies everything)
